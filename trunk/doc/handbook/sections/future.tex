\ldots is brighter then you expect. Main things to improve :

\tbrem{Nearly all this is done !}

\begin{itemize}

\item Optional image stacking prior to deconvolution, could give better photometry on faint targets

\item Photometric error bars ...

\item Importing functions for missing telescopes

\item Add some masking possibilities for the deconvolution itself (?)

\item Finetune sky-substraction

\item Splitup lookback ... way to slow right now.

\item Append curve shifting methods in a more straightforward way

\end{itemize}
