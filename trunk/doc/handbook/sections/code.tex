Tab width is 8 spaces. Most scripts have a common or very similar structure.

The usual script begins with :

\begin{lstlisting}
execfile("../config.py")	# global variables, imports sys and os
from pyraf import iraf		# if needed
from kirbybase import KirbyBase, KBError
from variousfct import *	# reading, backups, raising errors, etc...
\end{lstlisting}

To ask the standard question :

\begin{lstlisting}
print "I might do something unexpected."
proquest(askquestions)	# askquestions is a boolean flag set in config.py :
			# if False, we just go on
\end{lstlisting}


To select some images :

\begin{lstlisting}
db = KirbyBase()
images = db.select(imgdb, ['gogogo', 'treatme'], [True, True], sortFields=['mjd'], returnType='dict')
# imgdb : the path to database.dat
# ['gogogo', 'treatme'] : the fields on which you want to select
# [True, True] : the corresponding values (logical and)
# sortFields=['mjd'] is obvious...
# returnType='dict' : "images" is now a list of dictionaries of the selected entries.
\end{lstlisting}

You can now access any value from these dictionaries :

\begin{lstlisting}
for image in images:
	print image['seeing']
\end{lstlisting}

Or transform them to lists, if for instance you want to plot something :

\begin{lstlisting}
from pylab import *	# imports matplotlib and co
seeinglist = [image['seeing'] for image in images]
hist(seeinglist, 100)
show()
# you can replace show() by : savefig("seeing_histo.eps")
\end{lstlisting}

Adding a field to the database is easy :

\begin{lstlisting}
if "observername" not in db.getFieldNames(imgdb) :
	db.addFields(imgdb, ['observername:str'])
\end{lstlisting}

The typical main loop of the scripts looks like :

\begin{lstlisting}
for i, image in enumerate(images):
	print i+1, "/", len(images), ":", image['imgname']
	# this is useful to see the progress of slow scripts...
	[...]

\end{lstlisting}

If you want to update the database, do it from within the mainloop :

\begin{lstlisting}
	db.update(imgdb, ['recno'], [image['recno']], {'observername': "Hubble"})
	# directly writes to the database file
	# ['recno'] is name of the field (record number) that ...
	# [image['recno']] should match (i.e. record number of the current image).
	# {'observername': "Hubble"} : field and value to update

# (end of main loop)
db.pack(imgdb) # database maintenance...

\end{lstlisting}

And of course : send me any reusable scripts and let me know about suggestions.
