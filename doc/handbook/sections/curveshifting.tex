cosmouline is "one line per image, measurements in fluxes"

lcmanip is the tool to turn this into "one line per epoch, expressed as mags + error bars", i.e. combine per night.

Why a separate project ? Because this implies a lot of plots (want to do this on my laptop, not on a server), and sometimes some tweaks (like adding the fluxes of two sources etc)

Also this is the place to do some post-deconvolution rejections of bad images, and flagging bad nights etc.

The output of \verb+lcmanip+ is a plain rdb file.

This rdb file can be directly read in with pycs, while still keeping info like airmass, elongation, FWHM, skylevel etc.
